# Community Building & Organizing

## Through engagement and organizing, we encourage residents to take charge of their neighborhoods.

### NEIGHBORHOOD REVITALIZATION IS MORE THAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

Our holistic approach to community building focuses on placemaking. We encourage residents to take charge of their neighborhoods, by working with community management teams, resident driven groups and even new non-profits.
